# SRTB Integration Program

A tool used to integrate modchart data into SRTB files.

This project was initially hosted on the [Dynamic Track Speed repository](https://github.com/Raoul1808/DynamicTrackSpeed), but I decided to move the project to a different repository to avoid overwhelming the history with the integration tool.

## Building the project

Pre-requisites:
- An up-to-date Rust toolchain (preferably installed with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))

Steps:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `cargo build` or `cargo run` in a terminal
    - If you want to build/use the gui version, add the `--features gui` flag to the command(s) above.
3. Profit
